A major update to add configuration and port to 1.19.2.
<!--more-->

Changelog:
- Added a configuration system.  [View issue.](https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/36)
    - Allows enabling and disabling parts of the mod or the entire mod.
    - Also includes some advanced options:
        - "Leaning Magnitude" changes the intensity of the leaning effect.
        - "Rolling Magnitude" changes the intensity of the rolling effect.
        - All of these options are not something you should modify in a useful scenario, but may be fun regardless.
- Ported to 1.19.2. The new version is fully featured. [View issue.](https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/48)
- **Fixed:** Jittering while standing on a train. [View issue.](https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/47)
- **Fixed:** Some perspective stuff. [View issue.](https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/53)
- **Technical:** Now publishing sources jar to Modrinth for whatever reason.

Known Issues:
- A small workaround implemented in this update may cause some mods (including this one) to be ever so slightly jittery.
