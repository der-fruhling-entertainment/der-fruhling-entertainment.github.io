Hey there!

I've been working on a new Discord bot, named Soulfire. The bot's purpose is to allow servers to create linked roles for certain games that do not generally have linked role support.

Currently, this service is only available for Honkai Impact 3rd's Global servers (NA, EU, SEA). Any and all feedback is appreciated!

If/when Soulfire gets support for more games, I'll probably post about it somewhere around [here](https://xn--derfrhling-eeb.net).

Highlights:
- Easy to use and set up
- Automatic detection of server
- Displays the player's UID in their profile
- Ability to display usernames as well

Ways to submit feedback
- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/soulfire/discussions)
- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/soulfire/issues)
- Email to [soulfire@der-fruhling.mozmail.com](mailto:soulfire@der-fruhling.mozmail.com)

At the moment, the bot is not configurable. This may change later if the need arises.
