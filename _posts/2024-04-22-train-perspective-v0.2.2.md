Major updates to how the mod works, plus: standing players, tall train fix, camera leaning & rolling!

Download on Modrinth: [https://modrinth.com/mod/create-train-perspective](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-train-perspective)

### Changelog
- Player camera now leans while their train is on a slope. [View issue.](https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/11)
    - Also, camera now rolls when facing sideways on a slope.
    - (hopefully this feature doesn't break other mods)
- Player legs are now locked forward while seated on a train. [View issue.](https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/13)
- Players standing on a train will now be affected the same way as players sitting. [View issue.](https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/14)
    - This does not fix the Create mod issue where standing players may be ejected from the train if it is traveling at high speeds.
- Players riding taller trains now lean correctly. [View issue.](https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/16)

### Known Issues
- The mod's leaning is a bit jittery. [View issue.](https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/22)
    - This is probably more of a limitation of Minecraft itself. It might be fixable with a config option to emulate pitch, but that wouldn't make the player appear correctly to other players.
- The easing back to normal posture after jumping off a train on a slope could use some work. [View issue.](https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/23)
- The third-person camera is janky while on a train currently on a slope. [View issue.](https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/24)
