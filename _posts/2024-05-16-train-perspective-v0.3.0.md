Major update to fix major problems. The mod is in a pretty good state now.

Most things just work nicely, and the perspective is significantly smoother than the previous versions.
<!--more-->

Changelog:
- Players now look at their perceived down (e.g. the seat they're sitting in) rather than the real ground. [View issue.](https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/32)
- Fixed jittery leaning. [View issue.](https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/22)
- When targetting a block with the crosshair, the mod now makes some adjustments to target the block you should be looking at instead of the block the game thinks you're looking at. [View issue.](https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/35)
    - This is probably incompatible with anti-cheat mods/plugins.
    - The feature is also still _ever so slightly_ janky, but for most purposes it should be very usable.
- Fixed jittering of hand when traveling along the negative X axis.
- Fabric only: added a contact email.

In 0.1.2, I decided that the mod was basically ready and marked it as a Release version.

On second thought, I have realized the state of the mod and decided that Beta better describes its current state.
I have marked versions 0.2.2+ as Beta and all versions before that as Alpha to better represent this.

Of course, this does not mean that the mod is unusable or is going to break _everything_.
It just doesn't hold all the qualities I want it to.
In my opinion, A full Release version should be highly functional and configurable,
while retaining good compatibility with popular mods.

On that note, this version is _quality_ enough to be a release candidate,
and would be if it weren't for the missing things below:
- Configuration. [View issue.](https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/36)
- More accurate perspective. For a mod called "Create: _Train Perspective_", this is an important issue. [View issue.](https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/38)
- Some sound system and fog issues. Nothing major, but slightly annoying. [View issue.](https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/39)
