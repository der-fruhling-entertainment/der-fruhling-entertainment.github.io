A minor update to fix some perspective issues.

Download on Modrinth: [https://modrinth.com/mod/create-train-perspective](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-train-perspective)

### Changelog
- Fixed incorrect rolling when looking certain directions
- Now compatible with [do a barrel roll](https://modrinth.com/mod/do-a-barrel-roll) and hopefully other camera roll kinds of mods.
- The third-person camera while seated on a train is now improved. [View issue.](https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/24)

Known issues:
- The mod's leaning is a bit jittery. [View issue.](https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/22)
  - This is probably more of a limitation of Minecraft itself. It might be fixable with a config option to emulate pitch, but that wouldn't make the player appear correctly to other players.
  - Update: it's most definitely possible to fix this up. 
- The easing back to normal posture after jumping off a train on a slope could use some work. [View issue.](https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/23)
