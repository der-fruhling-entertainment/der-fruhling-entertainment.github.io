# Getting started with Soulfire

You can add the linked role by clicking on the server's name in the top left and selecting "Linked Roles."

When you link Soulfire to your account, you will be redirected to a webpage. You will be authenticated with Discord from that page and asked for your external game info (UID, username...) to complete the linking.

Once this is complete and you return to Discord to complete the process, your linked role will be assigned and the information will be displayed in your profile in channels specified by the server. The information will not be visible in every channel.

The URL you will be visiting looks like:<br>
`link.[game].soulfire.derfruhling.net`

This is the official method of linking Soulfire.
