# Getting started with Soulfire

You can add linked role(s) by clicking on the server's name in the top left and selecting "Linked Roles." From here, the server may use Soulfire as a linking option.

When you link Soulfire to your account, you will be redirected to a webpage. You will need to login with Discord and will be asked for your external game info (UID, username...) to complete the linking.

Once this is complete and you return to Discord to complete the linking, your linked role will be assigned and the information will be displayed on your profile in channels specified by the server. The information will not be visible in every channel.

The URL you will be visiting looks like:<br>
`link.[game].soulfire.derfruhling.net`.

This is the official method of linking Soulfire.
