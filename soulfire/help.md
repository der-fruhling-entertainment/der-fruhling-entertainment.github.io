# Soulfire Manual: Getting Started with the Soulfire bot

In order to start using Soulfire, you must first create a role. It can be any role you can manage yourself.

Once you have a role, you must add Soulfire as a linked role requirement. From there, you can configure some requirements for that particular role, such as server requirements. You can additionally add more linked role requirements to this role.

### Usage

Members can add the linked role by clicking on the server's name in the top left and selecting "Linked Roles."

When a member attempts to link Soulfire to their account, they will be redirected to a linking page. They will be authenticated with Discord from that page and asked for their external game info (UID, username...) to complete the linking. Once this is complete and the user returns to Discord to complete the process, the linked role will be assigned and the information will be displayed in their profile.

**Note:** In order for the player information to show in members' profile, the linked role **must** be added to the permissions of the channel. No permission overrides need to be assigned, but it must be present in the list.

The exact URL your members will be visiting looks like: `link.[game].soulfire.derfruhling.net`.

This is the official method of linking Soulfire.
