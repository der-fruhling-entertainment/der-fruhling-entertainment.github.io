# Code of Conduct

Hey there!

If you're making an issue, pull request, discussion thread, or generally any interaction with a project using this CoC, you must abide by it's rules.

The rules described in this document are primarily oriented towards what this project's owner(s) consider significant issues. It's enforcement is entirely up to project maintainers and/or an assigned moderation group to enforce.

Projects that use this Code generally do not _want_ to remove your content. If you are making a good-faith attempt to interact with the project, you should have nothing to worry about.

> It is permitted to copy, modify, and use this Code of Conduct in any project, regardless of administation or origin. If you use this Code of Conduct in your own project, I ask that you enforce it to the extents required by its text.
> 
> In the event that you use this yourself, please read it entirely.

## General Requirements

1. Be the good you want to see in the world. Do not intimidate, harass, or otherwise cause issues or injustice against another person.
2. Do not discriminate against another person for any reason, excluding the quality of contributed code or solutions as compared to an alternative.
3. Please keep NSFW content and references out of this project.
4. Advertising through the project through any means is not allowed.
5. Spam is not permitted.

### Issue Requirements

1. If there is an issue template provided, it must be used.
2. Issues must accurately describe the problem and/or feature request.
3. Issue creators are expected to first search to see if their issue/feature request has already been posted.
   - Failure to do this will result in your issue/feature request being closed as a duplicate.
4. Issue comments must be relevant and on-topic. Discussing qualtities of the author not directly related to the issue is not considered on-topic.

### Pull Request Requirements

1. If a `CODEOWNERS` file exists in the repository, all code owners relevant to the changes must review the pull request before it can be accepted.
2. If there are C/I checks defined in the repository, all checks must pass unless they are:
    1. not related to the pull request at hand;
    2. tasks intended to publish or deploy code to a production environment;
    3. tasks intended to create or delete comments.
3. All styling and programming guidelines specific to the repository, if any, must be followed exactly. If the repository requires a specific formatter to be run, you must run that formatter before your changes are accepted.
4. No pull request, excluding those created by the repository's owner or repository administators, may change the following files:
    1. `readme.md`;
    2. the license;
    3. the CODEOWNERS file, if any;
    4. the MAINTAINERS file, if any;
    5. the CHANGELOG file, if any;
    6. any document applying this Code of Conduct.
5. No pull request shall be created for the explicit purpose of being a temporary joke, unless:
    1. it is contributed on the day April 1st;
    2. it is contributed to a branch named `april-fools`;
    3. the project owners or maintainers have explicitly approved this purpose with the above branch.

### Discussion Requirements

1. Discussions must be relevant and accurately assigned a category, tags, and labels.
2. For Q&A discussions, please ensure you have searched for your question in both the discussions page and the issues page.
3. Also for Q&A discussions, blatently incorrect or AI generated answers will be deleted.

## Maintenance Requirements

In this section, "contribution" refers to issues, pull requests, discussions, commits, and any comments on any of those.

1. No project owner, maintainer, or contributor may reject or flame a contribution for any reason not related to the nature of the code itself, the solutions presented, or the problem complained of.
2. No project maintainer or contributor may appoint maintainers without the explicit permission of one or more project owners.

## Conclusion & statement

This project welcomes and contributions of any form that comply with the above requirements.

This project, by using this CoC, will enforce it to the extent that it's text requires.
